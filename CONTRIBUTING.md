## Working with Claude Code skills

This repo ships Claude Code skills that automate common workflows.

### Testing plugins locally

#### Using `--plugin-dir` (recommended)

Use the `--plugin-dir` flag to load plugins directly during development without requiring installation:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./communication
```

You can load multiple plugins at once:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./communication --plugin-dir ./decision-making
```

As you make changes, run `/reload-plugins` inside Claude Code to pick up updates without restarting. Then test your plugin components:

- Try your skills with `/plugin-name:skill-name`
- Check that agents appear in `/agents`
- Verify hooks work as expected

When a `--plugin-dir` plugin has the same name as an installed marketplace plugin, the local copy takes precedence for that session.

> See the [official documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins#test-your-plugins-locally) for more details.

#### Using `/link-for-testing`

Alternatively, run once after cloning to symlink all skills for local testing:

```
/link-for-testing
```

### Adding a new plugin

Use the `/add-plugin` skill to register a new plugin in the marketplace catalog and update the README:

```
/add-plugin <plugin-name>
```

This updates `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` and the `## Plugins` table in `README.md`.

### Adding a skill or agent to an existing plugin

After creating a `SKILL.md` under `<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/`, run the `/update-plugin` skill to update the plugin's README and bump its version:

```
/update-plugin
```

### Validating before committing

Before opening a PR, run the `/validate-marketplace` skill to check that all JSON is valid, required fields are present, local paths exist, and skill frontmatter is correct:

```
/validate-marketplace
```
